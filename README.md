"Retro Meets Python: My Snake Game Adventure"

Bringing back nostalgia with a modern Python twist! üéÆüêç I‚Äôve recreated the iconic Snake Game from the ground up, turning a simple idea into an engaging coding challenge. This project captures the charm of the original game while diving deep into the world of game development using Python.

KEY FEATURES OF MY SNAKE GAME INCLUDE :

1)Interactive gameplay with smooth and responsive controls.
2)Progressive difficulty as the snake grows longer with each ‚Äúfood‚Äù consumed.
3)Collision detection that ends the game if the snake hits itself or the boundaries.
4)A grid-based environment to keep the gameplay simple yet challenging.
5)Modular design to allow for easy adjustments and scalability in future updates.
6)This project has been an excellent opportunity to dive deep into:

Event-driven programming and Python‚Äôs Pygame library.
Understanding how to manage game states, scoreboards, and speed scaling.
Writing clean, maintainable code using functions and object-oriented principles.
